Its focus on vulnerable children in situations where they are at risk of falling through the cracks or being damaged by malfunctions in the system fills a critical void.

	<p class="title2"> Living an abuse free life is more than a hope or a dream</p>

	<section class="description3">Hope for Children Foundation is committed to the goal of ensuring that children in Texas and across the nation can live free from abuse. To achieve this goal, the organization has brought together a team of distinguished experts who provide comprehensive state and federal training to Texans. This statewide training initiative was made possible through partial funding from the United States Department of Justice's Violence Against Women Fund, as well as the Office of the Texas Governor Criminal Justice Division. The training program has received a positive response, with evaluation comments reflecting its success. Through collaborative efforts, Hope for Children Foundation is taking important steps towards creating a safer and more secure future for children, and your support can help make this goal a reality. </section>
